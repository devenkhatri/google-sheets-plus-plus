# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Airtable Clone application to protect user data and prevent common security vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks:

- **XSS Protection**: HTML content is sanitized using DOMPurify to remove potentially malicious scripts and event handlers.
- **SQL Injection Protection**: SQL keywords and special characters are filtered from query parameters.
- **Input Validation**: Express Validator is used to validate input formats and constraints.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with proper expiration and signature verification.
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure API key generation and validation for programmatic access.
- **Permission-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained access control for bases, tables, and records.
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and secure password hashing.

### 3. Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC encryption.
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive information is masked in logs and audit trails.
- **HTTPS**: All communication is encrypted using TLS/SSL.

### 4. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

- **Rate Limiting**: API requests are rate-limited based on IP address or API key.
- **Burst Detection**: Short-term burst detection to identify potential DDoS attacks.
- **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocking of suspicious IP addresses with escalating block durations.

### 5. Security Headers

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources can be loaded and executed.
- **HSTS**: Forces HTTPS connections.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls information sent in the Referer header.

### 6. Audit Logging

- **Security Events**: All security-related events are logged with relevant context.
- **Authentication Attempts**: Successful and failed authentication attempts are logged.
- **Data Access**: Access to sensitive data is logged.
- **Administrative Actions**: All administrative actions are logged.

### 7. GDPR Compliance

- **Data Export**: Users can export all their personal data in a machine-readable format.
- **Data Deletion**: Users can request deletion of their personal data.
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored.

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never Trust User Input**: Always validate and sanitize all user input.
2. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.
4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Testing**: Perform regular security testing and code reviews.

### For Administrators

1. **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular backups of all data.
2. **Security Updates**: Keep all systems and dependencies up to date.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity.
4. **Incident Response Plan**: Have a plan in place for security incidents.
5. **User Training**: Train users on security best practices.

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set for security configuration:

```
# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-hex-key>
ENCRYPTION_IV=<16-byte-hex-iv>

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
BURST_LIMIT_MAX=10

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://example.com,https://www.example.com

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400
```

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
2. **Investigate**: Analyze logs and systems to determine the extent of the breach.
3. **Remediate**: Fix vulnerabilities and restore systems from clean backups.
4. **Notify**: Inform affected users and authorities as required by law.
5. **Review**: Conduct a post-incident review to improve security measures.

## Security Testing

Regular security testing is performed using:

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans for common vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual penetration testing by security professionals.
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to security@example.com. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by our team.
