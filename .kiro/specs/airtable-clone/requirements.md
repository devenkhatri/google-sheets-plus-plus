# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a fully functional clone of Airtable that uses Google Sheets as the data storage backend. The application will provide all core Airtable functionality including database-like operations, multiple view types, collaboration features, and advanced data manipulation capabilities. The system will be production-ready with proper authentication, real-time synchronization, and scalable architecture.

2. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent edits without data loss
3. WHEN a user makes changes THEN the system SHALL show real-time cursors and selections of other active users
4. WHEN a user comments on a record THEN the system SHALL support threaded discussions and notifications
5. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new access levels
6. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 5: Advanced Field Types and Formulas

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to use advanced field types and formulas, so that I can create sophisticated data relationships and calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a formula field THEN the system SHALL support mathematical operations, string functions, date functions, and logical operations
2. WHEN a user creates a lookup field THEN the system SHALL retrieve values from linked records in other tables
3. WHEN a user creates a rollup field THEN the system SHALL perform aggregations (sum, average, count, etc.) on linked records
4. WHEN a user links records THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity across tables
5. WHEN linked data changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update dependent formula, lookup, and rollup fields
6. WHEN a user creates an attachment field THEN the system SHALL support file uploads with preview capabilities

### Requirement 6: Import and Export Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import existing data and export my work, so that I can migrate from other tools and share data externally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports a CSV file THEN the system SHALL automatically detect field types and create appropriate table structure
2. WHEN a user imports from Excel THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and multiple sheets
3. WHEN a user exports data THEN the system SHALL support CSV, Excel, and JSON formats
4. WHEN a user exports a view THEN the system SHALL respect current filters and field visibility settings
5. WHEN importing large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and handle files up to 100MB
6. WHEN data validation fails during import THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 7: API and Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with external systems through APIs, so that I can automate workflows and connect with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates an API key THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful API access to all data operations
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL support CRUD operations with proper authentication
3. WHEN a user sets up webhooks THEN the system SHALL notify external systems of data changes
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry guidance
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include proper pagination for large datasets
6. WHEN automation rules are created THEN the system SHALL support triggers based on field changes, record creation, and time-based events

### Requirement 8: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can work efficiently across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
