# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you create your first base and start organizing your data.

## Creating Your First Base

A **base** is like a database that contains related tables. Think of it as a project workspace.

### Step 1: Create a New Base

1. Click the **"+ New Base"** button on your dashboard
2. Choose a name for your base (e.g., "Project Management", "Customer Database")
3. Add an optional description
4. Click **"Create Base"**

Your base will be automatically connected to a new Google Sheets document for data storage.

### Step 2: Create Your First Table

Tables organize your data into rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet.

1. In your new base, click **"+ Add Table"**
2. Give your table a name (e.g., "Tasks", "Contacts", "Inventory")
3. Click **"Create Table"**

### Step 3: Add Fields (Columns)

Fields define what type of information you want to store.

1. Click the **"+"** button next to existing field headers
2. Choose a field type:
   - **Text**: For names, descriptions, notes
   - **Number**: For quantities, prices, scores
   - **Date**: For deadlines, birthdays, events
   - **Single Select**: For status, priority, category
   - **Checkbox**: For yes/no, completed/incomplete
3. Give your field a name
4. Configure any options (like dropdown choices for Single Select)
5. Click **"Save"**

## Adding Your First Records

Records are the rows of data in your table.

### Method 1: Add Records Manually

1. Click the **"+ Add Record"** button at the bottom of your table
2. Fill in the information for each field
3. Press **Enter** or click **"Save"** to create the record

### Method 2: Import Data

If you have existing data in a spreadsheet:

1. Click the **"Import"** button in the toolbar
2. Upload your CSV or Excel file
3. Map the columns to your fields
4. Click **"Import Data"**

## Understanding Views

Views are different ways to look at the same data. Your table starts with a Grid view, but you can create others:

- **Grid View**: Spreadsheet-like table (default)
- **Kanban View**: Cards organized by status or category
- **Calendar View**: Records displayed on a calendar
- **Gallery View**: Cards with image previews

To create a new view:
1. Click the **"+ Add View"** button
2. Choose your view type
3. Configure the settings
4. Give it a name

## Basic Operations

### Editing Records
- Click any cell to edit its value
- Use **Tab** to move to the next field
- Use **Enter** to save and move to the next record

### Filtering Data
1. Click the **"Filter"** button in the toolbar
2. Choose a field to filter by
3. Select your condition (equals, contains, etc.)
4. Enter your filter value
5. Click **"Apply"**

### Sorting Data
1. Click any column header
2. Choose **"Sort A→Z"** or **"Sort Z→A"**
3. For multiple sorts, use the **"Sort"** button in the toolbar

## Sharing Your Base

To collaborate with others:

1. Click the **"Share"** button in the top-right
2. Enter email addresses of people to invite
3. Choose their permission level:
   - **Viewer**: Can see data but not edit
   - **Commenter**: Can add comments but not edit data
   - **Editor**: Can edit data and structure
4. Click **"Send Invitations"**

## Next Steps

Now that you have the basics down:

- Explore different [view types](./views.md)
- Learn about [advanced field types](./advanced-fields.md) like formulas and lookups
- Set up [filters and sorts](./filtering-and-sorting.md) to organize your data
- Try [importing data](./import-export.md) from existing spreadsheets

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic field types and add complexity as needed
2. **Plan Your Structure**: Think about how your data relates before creating multiple tables
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear field and table names make collaboration easier
4. **Regular Backups**: Export your data periodically as a backup
5. **Explore Views**: Different views can reveal insights in your data
